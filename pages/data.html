        <h3> Main Dataset: </h3>
            <p> The main dataset used for this project was the John's Hopkins COVID-19 tracker GitHub page using <a 
                                                                                                             href='https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/raw/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv'>Confirmed Cases</a> and <a 
                                                                                                             href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv'>Number of Deaths</a>
                This dataset includes the total number of cases for each county within the United States (including territories
                which were exluded in this project). The dataset has a column for each date since January 22nd 2020 with the 
                cummalitive sum number of cases. 
                <br/>For this project only the following columns were used:'Province_State', 'Admin2'(Name of the county), and 'date'. </p>
        <h3> Auxillary Datasets: </h3>
            <p> A number of datasets were used from the US Census Bureau including shape and population data: </p>
            <ul><li> Shape files of the US states. The geometry column was used for mapping and animations while the ALAND (land 
                    area in m^2) was used to calculate population density

                <h4>How To Get Shape Files:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In terminal use the following bash command: wget [Link]-o [New File Name]</li>

                    <li>Should be downloaded as zip files</li>
                </ul><br/>
                <li> US State population estimations. Only the state names and data for 2019 were used <a href='Annual Estimates
