      <h3>Project Summary</h3>
      <p>In this project we analyze data from the COVID-19 epidemic and demonstrate how it has affected the United States, and more specifically the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. We examine ways variables such as population density, average daily cases and mortality rates have resulted in different outcomes in the two states. Additionally, we look at broader national trends and compare them to how Wisconsin and Minnesota have performed.
